                        <p class="question">
                            How do I sign up for service?</p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Call our office (910) 893-6873 or (910) 960-0032 where one of our secretaries will walk you through the process. They will ask basic questions to set you up an account and then help you to determine the service you would like. Together a start date will be determined. You can call and set up your service months in advance if you are planning to move into the area, to get one last thing off your mind when you get here! (Note: Depending on the area in which you live, a few months payments may be requested and must be paid either in advance or upon arrival at your house your first day of service and must be paid before receiving your Don's Trash trash can. If you have not received trash can by your first day of service, leave trash by curb in bags and/or boxes by 6:30am)</p>

                        <p class="question">
                            What time should I put my trash out?</p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            We ask that all trash, recycling, yard work, and special pick ups are set out by the curb, by 6:30am on your scheduled pick up day or days. We advise you not to set it out around the time the truck usually picks up at your house, have it out at the time advised to ensure your garbage is picked up. If your trash can is by your house it WILL NOT be picked up, drivers are not advised to go up to the house unless to collect payment on your first day of service.</p>

                        <p class="question">
                            How does billing and payments work?</p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Bills are mailed out at the end of every month and are due the 5th of the following month. We accept cash, checks, money orders, and credit and debit cards. Payments can be mailed or brought to the office, or called in over the phone. We DO NOT keep card information on file. If you are crunched for time there is always the option to set it up through your bank to mail a check out for you monthly. Please include your serviced address and account number on all checks and money orders.  ATM located conveniently at our office. </p>

                        <p class="question">
                            Who do I make checks payable to?</p>
                        <p class="answer">

                        <p class="question">
                            How do Special Pick Ups work?</p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            If you have an item and/or items that are not typical household garbage (washing machines, furniture, excessive yard work, grills, exercise equipment, construction disposal, etc) call the office to schedule a special pick up. Depending on what the item and/or items are, you may need to  receive an estimated cost of pick up. When in doubt call our office so we can best serve you! (Note: Certain items can puncture and/or damage our trucks which is why special pick ups should be scheduled to ensure your unwanted items get disposed of properly with no damage)</p>
